# The Elevator Excercise

Resolution for Elevator Excercise

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. java 8
2. maven 3

### Introduction

Implementation of elevator excercice proposed for an interview.
This solution was designed considering OOP concepts and some common patterns like strategy and observer. 

## Scope
In order to simplify the excercise and deliver an excercise that adds value in first version, I have done some simplifications that can be completed in next iterations

1. IoC container is not included in this version
2. KeyCard Access system was implemented using a simple and dummy mechanism
3. KeyCard Reader was implemented using a simple and dummy mechanism
4. Logs are being done using primitive java console

## Running the tests

```
mvn clean test

```
### Demo

There is a class called ElevatorSimulatorDemo.java, on that class you can find scenarios and a simple non-interactive demo for validating most common scenarios
